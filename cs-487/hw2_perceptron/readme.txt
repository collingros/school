to run my program:
	python3 main.py perceptron iris.data.txt
	python3 main.py adaline iris.data.txt
	python3 main.py sgd iris.data.txt

if you edit the last few lines in main.py, you can change the
learning rate/number of iterations, as well as the subset that
is used for testing vs training the model (see my comments).
