1. The principle based ethic most applicable to this scenario is Kantianism. The unacceptablility of lying makes the wrong choice the one in which Ms. Knowsalot lies. By lying, Ms. Knowsalot prevents the source from directly reaching the patient, which is wrong. Therefore, the correct thing for Ms. Knowsalot to do in this scenario is to tell the truth, and immediately announce the results of the report.

2. The most applicable ethical theory to this scenario is Utilitarianism. This theory states that the right choice is the one that promotes the greatest amount of good for the greatest amount of people. Clearly, if delaying the announcement of the results promotes good for both the patients, and the employees at ACME, then the greatest good is achieved for the greatest amount of people. Lying will hurt both the employees AND the patients, even though the patients live longer.

3. Pro: Lying and delaying the report results will promote the most amount of good to the most amount of people. Con: Lying and delaying the results may not promote good for the relatives of the patients, or the patients themselves, if either of them disagree with the assumption that the good brought by Evercil is not exceeded by the bad brought by Evercil (the lifespan reduction).
