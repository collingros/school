to run my code, first compile with:
	make
then, run it by executing:
	./run [bandwith of link] [bandwidth requirement
	of each user] [total number of users] [probability
	that any particular user is idle at a given time]
	[a target number of users]

the output will be the % probability that the target nmber of users
are online at any time.
