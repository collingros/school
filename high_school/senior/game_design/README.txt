everything here was for a "Game Design" class

the class was awful; we finished assignments from a third-party C# game design course
and learned nothing. we had to fill in code in "focus areas" for our grades

THIS DID NOT TEACH ME C#

including this in github anyway, because i like looking back at crap i had to do
a long time ago


edit 12/11/2019:
	decompressed all files, deleted .tar.gz file, removed 90% of the
	course since it was all shit and too big, kept the rest just for
	looking back at how horrible their teaching was/for nostalgia
