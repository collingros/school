this directory contains my code for solving Problem 1. in the
problem.pdf problem description.

to run my code, first compile with:
	make
and run with:
	./run [_le name] [time (s) required for baboon to cross]

for a demo, you can try running on one of the test files i have in
./tests:
	./run ./tests/fifo.txt 4

to cleanup all object files/binaries:
	make clean


note: view the ./sources directory for sources i used while writing this
		code. this code is 100% mine, though there may be some influences
		from these sources present in it.
