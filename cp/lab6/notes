don't add the symbol table

add global var to pass result from yacc to the printer


we have a decl and a list of decls
$1
[]
	$2
	[]->[]->[]
	next->next

$1->next = $2
$1	$2
[]->[]->[]->[]
	next->next


"true for everything except varlist because it needs to connect to other
variable declarations"?
