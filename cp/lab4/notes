tasklist
1. add rules to yacc (enhance yacc to allow syntax)
2. fix symtab, and test them without having yacc (use c to test, with main)
3. enhance lex (strdup, return string pointers instead of just a number)
4. semantic action in yacc


search and insert are things that need major work
instead of main they gave you,
printf search returns (search myfirst)
insert(myfirst, 0)
insert("mysecond", 1)
insert("mythird", 2)
prtinf("search returns ", search("myfirst"))
display

	else {
		p->symbol = strdup(Sym);
		p->addr = offset;
}
