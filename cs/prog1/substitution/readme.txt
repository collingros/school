a. to display the frequency analysis, you would need to print int *freqs (line 52 in decrypt.c)
b. to guess the cipherkey and decrypt the text, enter 'n' when prompted.
c. to enter a manual key, enter 'y' when prompted.

i decided to try shifting all of the letters in the ciphertext, to see if i would get any more detected words. then, i tried replacing every letter with another letter to see if it helped the word count. after i got close enough to where i could recognize some words (e.g., 'security), i did NOT swap any of those letters. then, i looked for more words and swapped those letters so they would make sense. finally, i decryped the ciphertext.
